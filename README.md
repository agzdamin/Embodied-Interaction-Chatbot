# Chatbot Mood Analyzer

This project is a simple chatbot built using **PHP (object-oriented)** and the **ChatGPT API**, designed to explore how chatbot interactions can influence users' moods.

---

## Project Overview

With the increasing interaction between humans and chatbots—such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and other AI chat assistants—this project aims to investigate how a chatbot can affect a user's emotional state (mood).

## System Workflow

1. **User Input:**  
   The user writes a sentence, and the system detects their current mood (e.g., happy, sad, neutral).

2. **Chatbot Tone Adjustment:**  
   Based on the detected mood, the chatbot changes its tone and interaction style to match or complement the user’s mood. Implemented using **ChatGPT API**.

3. **Mood Evaluation:**  
   After the conversation, the user fills out a questionnaire to evaluate whether the chatbot interaction affected their mood.
